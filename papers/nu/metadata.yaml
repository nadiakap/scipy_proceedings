abstract:
   - Use of ML has become mainstream in many areas of business. There is no shortage of courses offering different paths to mastering ML skills. The most popular approaches are those of Andrew Ng and Jeremy Howard. The former assumes a decent mathematical background and is essentially deductive, while the latter approach is more inductive and requires high school level of math and limited coding skills. Obviously, both are valuable in their own ways.
   - In the practice of continual education, however, the unique challenge is to work with people of diverse educational backgrounds and quickly - without long term commitment - bring them to a level where they can start using ML for their applications.
   - Due to growing demand in fast ML education many professional education departments started to offer ML classes that do not require full time commitment from a student. However, they usually require decent Python coding skills. We are different in several aspects: we focus on concepts rather than skills and require only minimal coding background. We focus on concepts that underly ML methods rather than specific ML methods. We cater to a wider student audience.
   - To address this challenge, we use the ideas borrowed from teaching of Operations Research (OR). After providing the students with a brief overview of ML approaches and tools, we offer them a menu of possible projects that can be tweaked to their specific goals and requirements. Among such projects are the ones based on diet, assignment, scheduling and logistic problems. Those classical problems from OR field can be tweaked to become machine learning models. Having selected the projects, the students continue to work on them for the rest of the course.
   - Our methodology may be useful for instructors of ML in professional education, as well as engineering undergraduate programs.
